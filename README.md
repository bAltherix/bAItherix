# **bAItherix - BECIA v4.0 + PaxCore SSPS v1.0**    
### **A Standardized Session State Persistence System (SSPS) and Intelligence Architecture for Large Language Model Agents**

**BECIA** (Behavioral & Cognitive Internal Architecture) and **PaxCore SSPS** (Session State Persistence System) together form a lightweight, deterministic architecture for building AI agents with:

- stable internal session state  
- reproducible behavior  
- portable memory  
- full reconstruction from persistent snapshots  

This repository contains the **first working implementation** of **SSPS v1.0**, a minimal system for agent continuity that is:

- model‑agnostic  
- runtime‑agnostic  
- storage‑agnostic  
- deterministic  
- fully testable end‑to‑end  

The system is intentionally small, transparent, and auditable — designed to be understood, extended, and adopted as a standard.

---

## **Why this exists**

Most agent architectures today suffer from the same fundamental limitation:

> They cannot reliably *remember*, *reconstruct*, or *continue* their internal session state.

Every system reinvents memory differently.  
Every system is brittle.  
Every system is opaque.  
None provide a portable, deterministic representation of “who the agent is” across time.

**SSPS solves this by defining a minimal, deterministic representation of an agent’s session state**, enabling:

- stable continuity  
- safe reconstruction  
- predictable behavior  
- cross‑runtime portability  

**BECIA v4.0** is the reference runtime that produces and consumes SSPS session snapshots.  
**PaxCore** is the reference persistence backend.

## **What’s included**

### **BECIA v4.0**
- Deterministic runtime  
- Core state builder  
- Reconstruction engine  
- SSPS memory layer  
- Schema validator  
- Session snapshot generator  

### **PaxCore SSPS v1.0**
- In‑memory persistence backend  
- Snapshot validator  
- BECIA adapter  
- SSPS schema (JSON)  
- Minimal core implementation  

### **Tests**
- Full integration test (BECIA ↔ PaxCore)  
- Reconstruction test  
- End‑to‑end runtime test  

All tests pass:
```
3 passed in 2.67s
```

This confirms the full cycle:
```
**Session Snapshot → PaxCore → Reconstruction → Runtime**
```
is stable, deterministic, and lossless.

```
### **BECIA responsibilities**
- Build core session state  
- Validate state  
- Generate SSPS snapshot  
- Reconstruct from snapshot  
- Provide deterministic runtime behavior  

### **PaxCore responsibilities**
- Validate snapshot schema  
- Persist session state  
- Return snapshot for reconstruction  
- Guarantee structural continuity  

---

## **SSPS Session Snapshot (v1.0)**

A minimal, deterministic representation of an agent’s **session state**.

Properties:

- JSON‑serializable  
- Schema‑validated  
- Portable across runtimes  
- Portable across storage backends  
- Sufficient for full reconstruction  

This is the core of the standard.
