# BECIA v4 — Intelligence Architecture Ecosystem
### SSPS Session State Persistence System Protocol • PaxCore Memory Kernel
---

## Welcome

This site contains the public specifications for the **BECIA v4 Intelligence
Architecture**, the **SSPS Session State Persistence System Protocol**, and the **PaxCore Memory
Kernel**.

Together, these components define a minimal, deterministic, privacy‑aligned
continuity layer for LLM‑based agents.

The ecosystem is:

- **model‑agnostic**  
- **runtime‑agnostic**  
- **interoperable**  
- **designed for long‑term stability**  

---

## The Architecture at a Glance
Below is a high‑level view of how the components interact:

    participant SSPS as SSPS v1.0 (Snapshot Protocol)
    participant PaxCore as PaxCore v1.0 (Memory Kernel)

    BECIA->>SSPS: produce core_state
    SSPS->>PaxCore: serialize -> snapshot
    PaxCore-->>SSPS: load snapshot
    SSPS-->>BECIA: reconstruct core_state

```

This pipeline ensures **continuity** across sessions without storing raw logs,
transcripts, or sensitive content.

## Quick Start

Even without implementation code, the workflow is simple:

1. **BECIA** processes user input through layers L0–L5  
2. BECIA produces a **core_state**  
3. **SSPS** serializes core_state into a **snapshot**  
4. **PaxCore** stores the snapshot  
5. On the next session, PaxCore loads the snapshot  
6. SSPS reconstructs core_state  
7. BECIA resumes with continuity  

Full details are available in the specifications below.
